I am playing around with this dataset because:

1.  The database is fairly small 
2.  It mirrors the size, and type of data that I could use in my job  
3.  I can map business use-cases to this data structure  

This is mostly for fun, and to learn how I can work through my ideas to solve business problems.  Mostly, I want to learn how I could operationalize these models in production.


## The description

This is from Kaggle website.

> Use recipe ingredients to predict the category of cuisine
> 
> Picture yourself strolling through your local, open-air market... What do you see? What do you smell? What will you make for dinner tonight?
> 
> If you're in Northern California, you'll be walking past the inevitable bushels of leafy greens, spiked with dark purple kale and the bright pinks and yellows of chard. Across the world in South Korea, mounds of bright red kimchi greet you, while the smell of the sea draws your attention to squids squirming nearby. Indiaâ€™s market is perhaps the most colorful, awash in the rich hues and aromas of dozens of spices: turmeric, star anise, poppy seeds, and garam masala as far as the eye can see.
> 
> Some of our strongest geographic and cultural associations are tied to a region's local foods. This playground competitions asks you to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients.

## Populate Neo4j

1.  Make sure that `neo4j` is running  
2.  Run the script `R/build-database.R` which reads the files and creates CSVs and wipes out any data that you have in `Neo4j` 
3.  Run the two shell commands found in `cypher/shell-commands.sh`  

This will add constraints, and then the data to the database. 

#### Data Considerations  

1.  It looks like there are some duplicate data.  For example, look at dish id `26165` in the training set.  Perhaps I parsed the files incorrectly, but it appears to be duplicate data.  Luckily we can use `MERGE` within `neo4j` to create unique nodes and edges.

## Scripts

1. `cypher/queries.cql` contains `cypher` code to query the database once you have imported everything.  
2. `R/explore-yummly.R` does the same within `R`  
3. `R/submissions.R` is the script that I am using to make my submissions.  This is currently under __heavy development__.  

## Current Status

Right now I am struggling to calculate the similarity between the dish nodes based on the ingredients that are part of each.  What I have attempted:

-  Running `cypher/jaccard-v1.cql` from neo4j-shell.  This can be found in `cypher/shell-commands.sh`  
-  Using `igraph` to calculate sub-graph similarities, but I paused this calculation after ~ 2 hours.  The code is found at the end of `R/submissions.R`
